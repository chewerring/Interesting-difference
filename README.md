# Interesting-difference
A program that calculates the difference between n and 17... unless n is bigger than 17...
When n is smaller than 17, this program calculates the difference between n and 17.
However, when n is bigger than 17, this program calculates the difference between 17 and n, and then multiplies it by 2.
For example, when n is 20, the output will be 6 because 20 - 17 is 3 and then 3 * 2 is 6.
